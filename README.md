<h1>Abstract</h1> Unidirectional RNNs, Bidirectional RNNs,
LSTMs, and GRUs represent significant advances
in deep learning, introducing novel concepts in
Artificial Neural Networks. Each of these four
types of Recurrent Neural Networks has unique
advantages and disadvantages, making it challenging to determine the best architecture for a given
problem. Given the prevalence of regression and
classification tasks, understanding which models
are best suited for each scenario is crucial. Although there has been published research on the
performance of these model architectures, previous studies have not simultaneously compared all
four architectures or applied them to both classification and regression scenarios. By conducting
a quantitative performance analysis of these diverse architectures, we aim to elucidate how each
model handles sequences of data and long-term
dependencies, thereby developing a more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities. These
model architectures are fundamental to deep learning and artificial intelligence, making informed
decisions about model selection based on desired
performance essential. The necessity for a quantitative analysis encompassing more than just two
model architectures motivated this studyâ€”a comprehensive performance analysis of four different
RNN model architectures applied to both classification and regression scenarios.
